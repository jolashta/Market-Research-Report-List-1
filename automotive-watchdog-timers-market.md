<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Watchdog Timers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Window Mode Watchdog Timer</li><li>Timeout Mode Watchdog Timer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive watchdog timers market primarily includes two types: Window Mode Watchdog Timers and Timeout Mode Watchdog Timers. Window Mode Watchdog Timers monitor the system by ensuring that operations occur within specific time windows. If events occur outside this window, the timer triggers a reset or fault response. In contrast, Timeout Mode Watchdog Timers count down to a predetermined timeout. If the system fails to reset the timer within this period, it signifies a fault, prompting corrective actions. Both types enhance automotive system reliability and safety.</p></p>
